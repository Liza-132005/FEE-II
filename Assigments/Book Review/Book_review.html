                <h2>Sherlock Holmes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>character-</b>8.5/10</li>
                    <li><b>story-</b>9.5/10</li>
                    <li><b>overall-</b>9/10</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As someone whom is way more than a Sherlock Holmes aficionado (I have read all 4 novels and all 56 short stories by Doyle), all I can say is Downey was exceptional; Ritchie’s directing was spot on; and Jude Law makes a superb Watson.

                    That said, the true question is does it compare to BBC’s modernized Sherlock?  In my opinion, they’re incomparable.  The tv series provides room for characters to evolve, and they do. Plus, it takes place in modern London.  Although his portrayal is so uniquely peculiar, I’d say Cumberbatch’s performance is as good and maybe even slightly better than Downey’s, but one must take into account that Downey had to craft a British accent which was a natural dialect for Cumberbatch.  The BBC Ms. Hudson was perfectly cast and well-played, another dimensional development to the TV series.  But I believe I prefer Jude Law as Watson to Martin Freeman. Loved them both. Kudos to Ritchie.
                    
                    Conclusively, as a movie, the Ritchie direction was incredible and Downey’s action Sherlock Holmes is riveting.</p>

                <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>character-</b>10/10</li>
                    <li><b>story-</b>10/10</li>
                    <li><b>overall-</b>9.75/10</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Harry Potter movies are the most favorite movies of all time for me since my childhood. Once I watched Harry Potter, first movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was obsessed with it and couldn't stop watching the other episodes. Honestly, my childhood was profoundly influenced by the world of Harry Potter.  Role-playing as a cast in Harry Potter movies, debating which Hogwarts house we belonged to, and shouting out magic spells to each other, with my friends, were the best fun and indelible memories of my childhood. 
                    The very first time when I watched Harry Potter, I was super excited to watch it, and indeed every scene in the movie was breathtaking and incredible for me, a child who likes magical world and fantasy things. Among the 8 movies of Harry Potter, of course, the rest 7 movies are great, yet I think the first movie is the best because if it wasn't good enough, no one would watch the rest 7 movies.</p>

                <h2>The Diary of a Young Girl</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>character-</b>9/10</li>
                    <li><b>story-</b>9.5/10</li>

                <p>I still believe and sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart that the planet is inhabited by a bunch of gems who look beyond the mundane,possess an uncanny semblance of serendipity and stand by the sheer beauty of doing absolutely nothing.After all,this is a pandemic and not a productivity contest.That being said,one profound source of influence in these times for me has been derived from the book 'Diary of a Young Girl' by Anne Frank.Although I read it way back in tenth grade,it still remains one of those literary works that stay with you and are relevant for years to come.What sets apart this highly nuanced book is that it captures the adolescent musings and frailties in a truly impeccable manner.I don't think that Anne realised that by putting her mere teenage rambles and whims she was leaving behind a great treasure,the treasure of thought.</p>
