            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <article>South Korea,[c] officially the Republic of Korea (ROK),[d] is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the
                southern part of the Korean Peninsula and borders North Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone;
                though it also claims the land border with China and Russia.[e] The country's western border is formed
                by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by the Sea of Japan. South Korea claims to be the
                sole legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. It has a population of 51.96
                million, of which half live in the Seoul Capital Area, the ninth most populous metropolitan area in the
                world. Other major cities include Busan, Daegu, and Incheon.</article>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <article>According to Korea's founding mythology, the history of Korea begins with the founding of Joseon (also
                known as "Gojoseon", or "Old Joseon", to differentiate it with the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BCE by
                the legendary Dangun.[29][30] Gojoseon was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century.[31]
                Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern Korean Peninsula and parts of Manchuria. Gija Joseon
                was purportedly founded in the 12th century BCE, but its existence and role have been controversial in
                the modern era.[30][32] In 108 BCE, the Han dynasty defeated Wiman Joseon and installed four
                commanderies in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward
                within a few decades. As Lelang Commandery was destroyed and rebuilt around this time, the place
                gradually moved toward Liaodong.[clarification needed] Thus, its force was diminished and only served as
                a trade center until it was conquered by Goguryeo in 313.</article><hr>
